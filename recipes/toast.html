        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Olive oil and oregano toasts is a quick, easy and tasty snack. It will also help you get rid of stale (stale, not moldy!) bread.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>bread - preferably bread that doesn't taste too sweet and isn't too soft, as that will make it hard to cut into thin-ish slices.</li>

            <li>oregano</li>
            <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut your bread into thin-ish slices.</li>
            <li>Put some olive oil on each toast. Don't drench them, but also don't leave them too dry.</li>
            <li>Salt them and put some oregano on top.</li>
            <li>Put them in the oven at medium heat for around 10 minutes.</li>

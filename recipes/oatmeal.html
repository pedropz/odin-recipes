        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A quick and healthy option for one of those colder days. It requires very little planning and is adaptable to as many or as little <br>
            ingredients as you want to add or have available.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>oats</li>
            <li>any type of milk</li>
            <li>bananas</li>
            <li>any berries</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Optionally:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>peanut butter</li>
            <li>vanilla</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, pour some oats and milk in a bowl. Preferably in a 1-to-1 ratio, but it's up to personal choice. I also recommend you pour<br>
            the oats first, as if you use the same measuring cup for the milk first, some of the oats might stick to it.</li>
            <p>This is where you can drop a teaspoon of vanilla, if you choose to do so.</p>
            <li>Stir the bowl.</li>
            <li>Put your bowl in the microwave for around 90 seconds. This might vary depending on the model of your microwave.</li>
            <li>Now, put whatever fruits you want on top of your oatmeal - and peanut butter if you want.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

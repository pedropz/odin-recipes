        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Overnight Oats is a quick, simple, versatile and nutritious breakfast option. If you use natural ingredients it can be a very healthy<br>choice and oats are a natural source of dietary fiber.</p>
        <p>It's also a refreshing meal on hotter days!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>300ml of any milk</strong> - preferably one with high protein like soy milk</li>
            <li><strong>one glass and a half of oats</strong> - preferably fine or ultrafine</li>
            <li><strong>one banana</strong></li>
            <li><strong>some berries of your choosing</strong> - I personally opt for dried blueberries or fresh strawberries</li>
            <li><strong>chia seeds</strong> - they have a nice texture when soaked and are a great source of omega 3's</li>
            <li><strong>20g of peanut butter</strong> - the more peanut butter the tastier your overnight oats will be, but I'd caution against using too<br>much as peanut butter is very calorie dense and high in saturated fats</li>
            <li>any other type of fruit you may want to add is fine. :)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p>Now, there's no right way to make Overnight Oats. If you wish, you mays just throw all your ingredients in a glass jar and mix them. <br>
            I usually have it layered as it avoids some annoying clumps of oats. It's up to you if you'd rather do it layered or mixed. Keep<br>
        reading if you'd like to know how I recommend you layer it.</p>           
        <ol>
            <li>First you'll want to get a glass of your milk of choice and your scoop of peanut butter and mix them with a blender or similar<br>
            equipment. This step is optional but if you don't do it you risk having dry-ish lumps of peanut butter and oats waiting for you.</li>
            <li>Now actually onto layering it. Find a tall glass jar (that's cup-ish) of reasonable size. Grab your fruits. Slice those fruits,<br>
                if applicable and place (or throw if you're feeling particularly violent) them into the bottom of the jar. This step is important<br>
                because it makes it unlikely that you'll get to the end of your meal and find some sad, plain oats staring back at you.</li>
            <li>Gently pour enough milk to cover your fruits.</li>
            <li>Pour some chia seeds.</li>
            <li>If you want more peanut butter, this would be a good time to throw some in. Other wise, just go ahead and pour some oats in.<br>
            Be careful to not pour too many oats at once, as that can make it so the milk cannot reach the bottom, leaving you with some dry,<br>
            boring oats.</li>
            <li>Pour some more milk in. If you notice that the milk isn't reaching the bottom of your oats, try gently shaking the jar.<br>
            If that doesn't work move the oats around with a spoon and make a mental note to pour less oats next time.</li>
            <li>Another optional scoop of peanut butter.</li>
            <li>Keep repeating this process until you've either used all of your ingredients or all the space in the jar.</li>
            <li>Enjoy! :)</li>
